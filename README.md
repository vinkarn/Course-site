## Implementation Details

### HTML
I used HTML to structure the website's content, ensuring that each element is semantically meaningful and contributes to the overall accessibility of the site. From headers and footers to articles and navigation menus, each HTML element is carefully chosen to create a well-organized and easily navigable structure.

### CSS
CSS was employed to style the website, focusing on creating a visually appealing and responsive design. Key techniques used include flexbox for layout, media queries for responsiveness, and CSS variables to maintain a consistent color scheme. The dark mode feature is implemented using CSS to toggle between light and dark themes seamlessly.

### JavaScript
JavaScript adds interactivity and enhances the user experience. Functions for toggling dark mode, dynamic content updates, and interactive elements such as form validation are all powered by JavaScript. I particularly enjoyed working with JavaScript to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.

## My Experience

Working on this project has been an incredibly rewarding experience. I thoroughly enjoyed:
- **Designing the user interface**: Combining HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
- **Adding interactivity**: Using JavaScript to make the website dynamic and engaging.

## Looking Forward

I am enthusiastic about continuing my journey in web development. This project has inspired me to:
- **Learn more advanced JavaScript frameworks**: Such as React or Vue.js to build more complex and scalable applications.
- **Explore back-end development**: To gain a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development.
